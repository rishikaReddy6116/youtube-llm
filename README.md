# 🎬 YouTube LLM Summarizer

This project extracts transcripts from YouTube videos, restores punctuation, cleans the text, and generates a clear, concise summary using lightweight LLMs via the OpenRouter API.

---

## ✅ Why This Project?

- 🔍 **Problem**: YouTube videos can be long and time-consuming to watch, especially when you're just looking for the key points.
- 💡 **Solution**: This tool automates transcript extraction and summarization — giving you a quick understanding of video content without watching it.
- ⚡ **Efficiency**: Designed to run even on low-resource machines (e.g., MacBook Air M2 with 8GB RAM), by using lightweight tools and external APIs instead of heavy local models.
